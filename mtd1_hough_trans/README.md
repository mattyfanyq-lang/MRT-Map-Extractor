## 🧠 Approach

1. **Pre-processing**
   - Clean the schematic image.
   - Convert from .pdf to .png.
   - Convert to greyscale and threshold to black and white.

2. **Line Extraction**
   - Detect edges using OpenCV.
   - Apply Hough line transforms to obtain `(ρ, θ)` representations.
   - Filter and merge overlapping or repeated segments.
   - Convert extracted lines into coordinate arrays.

3. **Data Output**
   - Store line coordinates in `downtown_line.json`.

4. **Visualisation**
   - Overlay extracted result onto original schematic to verify alignment.
